# example-vue-composition-api

Crash course with demo example application(s) showing vue3 and its composition api capabilities. Learn from reading and running code. Try out separate applications (intentionally, to have clean application scope) by passing chapter as argument and load up different use cases, features and etc. provided by the api. Have fun experimenting, learning and trying things out.
